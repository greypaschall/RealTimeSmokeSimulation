# RealTimeSmokeSimulation
A real-time smoke simulation using Unity's particle system and shaders.

# Implemented and working:
- Realtime Smoke Simulation
- Gravity influence with slider
- Wind force with slider
- Emission rate with slider (Needs adjustment)
- Randomized particle turbulence using Perlin Noise equation
- Implemented Navier-Stokes Approximation for velocity calculation and implementation of dynamic particle flow (Currently Approximated for performance, full Navier-Stokes can be implemented later)
- Implemented Beer's law for improved light absorption
- Implemented Dissipation using exponential decay (Needs tuning)

# Implemented but not yet working:
- Performance Monitoring
- Shaders are implemented but need improvement
- High quality Particle Textures

# Not yet Implemented:
- GPU based particle optimization
